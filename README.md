This is an example Maven project implementing an ImageJ command with a Pom adapted for PT-BIOP at EPFL.

This project was initially cloned from https://github.com/imagej/example-imagej-command.git (11th October 2018)

It is intended as an ideal starting point to develop new ImageJ commands.

Setting up IntelliJ IDEA with this command is detailed here (access restricted to BIOP members):
